        To start using E2E Messenger, please register a unique username that other users can use to
        identify you by (must be 3 or more alphanumeric characters, can include non-repeating underscores
        and dashes). \n\nYou must also select a password which will allow you to retain your username should you
        uninstall the app or wish to use it on another device (must be 6 or more characters). MAKE SURE YOU
        DO NOT LOSE THIS PASSWORD, AS THERE IS CURRENTLY NO PASSWORD RECOVERY FEATURE (I plan to add this in
        a future update).

        To add a new contact, press the add contact button on the action bar. \n\nNext you should
        type in your contact\'s username and the password that you agreed upon. Once you have done
        this, click \'send\' and the key exchange will be carried out automatically. \n\nIf the key
        exchange is successful then the contact\'s key status will be set to \'valid\', and you can then
        begin chatting securely by clicking the new message button (also on the action bar).
